        YOUR RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION
        Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws and regulations in relation to your personal data. You have the right to the following:
        a.	Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “Data Subject Access Request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

        b.	Request correction/rectification of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

        c.	Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with a legal obligation in Nigeria. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

        d.	Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

        e.	Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; and when you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

        f.	Request the transfer (commonly known as “Data Portability”) of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

        g.	Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.

        If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, that is, to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact the DPO.
        FEE FOR PROCESSING REQUEST & TIMELINE
        You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances by writing to you and copying NITDA.
        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
        We try to respond to all legitimate requests within a reasonable time. Occasionally, it could take us longer time if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
        BREACH
        In the event of a personal data breach leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data, we shall within a reasonable time of becoming aware of the breach:
        a)	promptly assess the risk;
        b)	promptly notify the affected data subject;
        c)	take all necessary measures and steps to ensure that further damage is not caused by the breach;
        d)	take all steps to retract the data (in cases of unauthorised access or disclosure); and
        e)	if appropriate, report the breach to NITDA.
